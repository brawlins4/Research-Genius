# Research-Genius
Research Genius is a tool designed using LibGuides CMS aimed at giving students an understanding of what it means to do college level research at Georgetown College and can be customized to fit your institution's needs.  It consists of three modules (Intro to Academic Research, Research as Inquiry, and Ethical Research).  The following are links to the individual LibGuides for each module.  The other files are templates files that we customized along with the CSS and JS files.
